## Project Overview
The Impact of Charging Stations on EV Sales

In recent years, more and more people have begun paying attention to global warming and renewable energy topics. Many governments across the world are racing against time to push more initiatives to cut down on carbon emissions and footprints. Thus, EV (electric vehicles) are now finally becoming more mainstream, considering that the European Union and the United States government will ban the sale of gasoline-based cars in the near future. However, in order to surpass and replace traditional gas cars, there are many obstacles ahead that prevent casual consumers from buying EV in the first place. One of those obstacles is the availability of EV charging stations.

In this project, we will investigate the number of EV charging stations along with the number of EV sold in the state of California in recent years. This will paint a picture of the EV market in the most populous state of America, and also identify any possible correlation between those two variables mentioned above.

Our main approach is to search for sale data from various EV manufacturers, along with many other reputable dataset from governmental sources. From there, we will apply what we have learned from this course to create a database from scratch, which will then be used for analysis to get a meaningful conclusion at the end. For this project to succeed, we will apply everything we learn so far including data cleaning, data validation, data modeling, logical modeling, sql and data visualization to meet our goals.
